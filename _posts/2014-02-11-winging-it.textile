I'm trying out a blogging platform. I started out with the idea of checking out static site generators. I'd had some success building something with Octopress (covermagnyc.com). I'd been waiting for 3.0, but need to move on. 

I'd been following "net art" in my twitter stream, without knowing it had already been named. Had to learn about it from Susan Orlean's New Yorker article. 

Meanwhile, there's an upcoming workshop I'm thinking to take from the Kitchen Table Coders on creating a bot to tweet on shedule. Not that I had an inkling to do this, but  learning how to set up a linode server is included. 

Kai in the meet4speed meetup sparked my interest in setting up my own server. He offered what I took as a challenge to get my hands dirty: i.e., really getting into my apps/sites nuts and bolts, in terms of performance. 

I need to get back to writing and also really trying to upgrade my git skills. This Jekyll blogging exercise will help with that. Writing in markdown is so  natural and fast. No tags!

I'm almost positive I'll blog about food and other unrelated topics, and might even change the name "Net_Art." But I'm following a family tradition. My mother named me Lori while reading a popular novel with a character of that name. She thought it was so unique. Then there were three Lori's in my first grade class. So the blog's name came as a momentary decision, thanks to Susan Orlean. I'll aim for the net artist's critical presence, or at least continue to observe it.
