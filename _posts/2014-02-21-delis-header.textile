Always on the lookout for a horizontal image; this one fit my series on deli design.  The series--photos of deli-convenience storefronts between 19th and 23rd street--is about quantity, and culminates with a spanking new 7eleven. The three delis on my corner are old standbys; Merci Market is central. They are microcosms of the Chelsea neighborhood they are populating, and of the economy. The Merci awning looked especially fetching with the snow patches&#8217; natural pattern. A detail&#8230;
