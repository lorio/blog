Happy to be back blogging and hanging with good friends: Jekyll, Sass, Github, and Textile. Textile, via the Hobix (the work of Why?) "Cheatsheet":http://redcloth.org/hobix.com/textile/quick.html was feeling atavistic. A Google "img list textile" search turned up some modern documentation, i.e. from "Moveable Type":http://movabletype.org/documentation/author/textile-2-syntax.html. Image lists should not cause agony but Textile tripped me up by separating my images with @<br>@. This short, free "tutorial":http://www.atozcss.com/the-css-display-property/ on CSS @display@ came to the rescue by suggesting that @white-space@ was the culprit.

I promised in a previous "post":http://lorio.github.io/blog/deli-design.html, these photos of convenience stores on 7th Ave. just below 23rd street. The photo essay is a reflection on the neighborhood businesses' efforts to stand out in the crowd. Since I started photographing them just months ago, the corner deli's bamboo sun-blinds that used to shade the flowers now hangs inside the windows like a backdrop behind various handwritten and official "closed" notices.
