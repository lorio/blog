I'm a longtime fan of street art -- found typography, graffiti, and graphics -- especially of surveyor's spray painted marks in bright flourescent colors on a wet, rain-darkened sidewalk. I'm something of a design detective and gumshoe.

Not sure when it was that "hello" stickers started metastisizing on lamposts and signal boxes. Nineties? Here's a particularly precious one.

Olde time neon. Will these be extinct? Will shoe repair shops be as few and far between as sewing machine repair shops, baking supply stores, and art supply stores? There are still some xxx and blue shops around Chelsea&#8230; TK. Please excuse my passive sentences and dangling thoughts&#8230;

I'm lovin' the Department of Transportation logo.

More truck art. Catchy juxtaposition of graffiti spray and grit as a background for bold, red sans-serif message in Vinyl. Scale and contrast.

There's no lack of inspiration for a New York City designer and gumshoe.
